<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack MVP for JSEVENT, an event company. The work progressed chronologically: starting with a detailed frontend build using mock data, followed by backend implementation with MongoDB and FastAPI. After comprehensive integration, the AI engineer developed a secured administration panel including user management, contact request handling, testimonial moderation, and a robust image/video gallery with upload functionality. Finally, all contact information was updated across the site. The current task revolves around delivering the completed project to the user in a convenient, downloadable format, specifically a Windows-compatible archive, after successfully generating a Linux-compatible archive and a shell script.

<product_requirements>
The user required a website for JSEVENT, an event company, with the slogan votre événement notre signature. The site needed to showcase detailed service packages for three event types: weddings, birthdays, and baptisms, each with Bronze, Silver, and Gold formulas including pricing and features. Additionally, the site must feature photobooth services (Photo One, Two, Three formulas), additional rentals (standing tables), candy bars, and custom object personalization. A critical requirement was a secure administration panel for managing client reviews, photo/video galleries, user accounts, and appointments. The current implementation includes all these features, with a fully functional frontend, an integrated FastAPI backend with MongoDB, and an admin interface for content and user management. Contact information has also been updated per the user's latest request.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components.
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (frontend), FastAPI APIRouter (backend).
- **API Interaction**: Axios (frontend).
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models (backend).
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure admin access.
- **File Storage**: Persistent storage of uploaded media.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase is structured into  (React application),  (FastAPI application), and root-level documentation/scripts.



- ****: The main FastAPI application entry point. It registers all API routers, handles CORS, and sets up the MongoDB client. It was modified to include new routers for admin, auth, and upload, and corrected a health check endpoint.
- ****: Define Pydantic models for data structures and MongoDB schemas (e.g., , , , , , ). These were newly created for each data entity and  was updated to correctly handle  as .
- ****: Contains FastAPI  instances, grouping API endpoints by functionality (e.g.,  for event packages,  for authentication,  for media uploads). These were all new additions as features were implemented.
- **, **: Scripts to populate MongoDB with initial data and create a default admin user. Essential for quick setup and testing.
- ****: Main React component managing application routes. Modified to integrate new sections and administration routes.
- ****: Centralized service for interacting with the backend API. It encapsulates Axios calls and error handling. New file created during backend integration.
- ****: Dedicated API service for administration panel interactions, including authentication and specific admin endpoints. New file.
- ****: Modular React components for UI elements.
    - , , : These were updated to reflect the new contact information (phone number, address) provided by the user.
    - , , : These components were initially built with mock data () and then extensively modified to fetch real data from the backend APIs.
    - , : New components to enhance UX during loading and secure admin routes.
- ****: React components defining the administration panel's various views (Login, Dashboard, Contact Requests, Testimonials, Gallery). These were all newly created for the admin feature.
- ****: Documents the API endpoints, data models, and integration strategy between frontend and backend. Crucial for understanding the system's interface.
- ****: Directory created to store uploaded image and video files persistently.
- ****: A bash script created to automate the recreation of the entire project structure and files on a new system. This provides a self-contained delivery mechanism.

<pending_tasks>
- Create a Windows-compatible archive (e.g.,  or ) or a batch script () for the JSEVENT website, as the  utility was not available in the environment to complete the user's explicit winrar request.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to provide a winrar compatible download of the completed JSEVENT website. The AI engineer had previously created a  archive and a  for Linux environments. When the user explicitly asked for winrar, implying a Windows-compatible format, the AI engineer attempted to create a  archive but failed because the  utility was not installed in the environment. Subsequently, the AI engineer initiated the creation of a Windows batch script, , to provide an alternative method for Windows users to recreate the project, reflecting the current active task.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the  script to allow users to easily set up the project on Windows.
